## Content Heirarchy
### Categories
Categories are used to establish high-level groupings of content. These are listed on the homepage and at the top of sidebar menus. 
  #### Editing Categories
  * Categories can be managed through the CMS by going to __Posts>Categories__.
  * To re-order the list of categories on the homepage, go to __Posts>Taxonomy Order__ and drag and drop them into the desired order. This will automatically update the homepage.
  * Each category should have a unique color that's used for hover and active states throughout the site. When adding a new category, make sure to add the following snippet to `category-colors.css`:
      ```css
      #category-slug label span:hover,
      #category-slug .current-post,
      #category-slug .ez-toc-list li a:hover,
      #category-slug .ez-toc-list li .active {
        color: #;
      }
      #category-slug .ez-toc-list .active {
        border-color: #;
      }
      #category-slug::after {
        background-color: #;
      }
      ```
      > Note that "#category-slug" needs to be replaced with the specific slug of the new category. This can be found in Posts>Categories
      
### Posts
Posts are used to organize a category into several different pages. These are listed in their parent category's sidebar menu.

### Sections (h2)
  Sections are used to organize a page into smaller chunks of content. These are listed as child items in the sidebar menu *only* when their parent post is active.


## User Management
  ### User Roles
  There are three tiers of user roles: Administrator, Group Admin and Editor. Group Admin's should be the stakeholders of each category. The main difference between a Group Admin and an Editor is the ability to add/delete/edit other users.

## Homepage
